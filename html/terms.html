        <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>In accordance with the laws of England and Wales, Consumers have the right to cancel their order for Products without giving any reason within 60 days from the day on which the Consumer, or a third party indicated by the Consumer other than the carrier, acquires physical possession of the goods.

The Company will provide the Consumer with a confirmation of receipt of such a cancellation.</p>
        <p>To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for the Consumer to send their communication concerning the exercise of the right of cancellation before the cancellation period has expired. If the Consumer cancels this contract, the Company shall reimburse all payments received from the Consumer, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from the Consumer’s choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Company), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which the Company is informed about the Consumer’s decision to cancel this contract. The reimbursement will be carried out using the same means of payment as the Consumer used for the initial transaction, unless the Consumer has expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, the Consumer will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>

The Consumer will bear the direct cost of returning the goods. If the goods, by their nature, cannot be returned normally by post, the Consumer will bear the direct cost of returning the goods.</p>
        <p>The Consumer is only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics, and functioning of the goods.</p>
